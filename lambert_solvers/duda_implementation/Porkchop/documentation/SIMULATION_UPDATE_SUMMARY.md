## Simulation Duration Update Summary

### Changes Made
The simulation has been successfully updated to run for the duration of **one complete LEO satellite orbit** instead of 24 hours.

### New Simulation Parameters
- **Duration**: 88.5 minutes (1.47 hours) - One complete LEO orbit
- **Time interval**: 1 minute (unchanged)
- **Total data points**: 90 (reduced from 1,441)

### Key Results for One LEO Orbit Duration

#### LEO Satellite (200km altitude)
- **Completes**: 1.0 complete orbit (360°)
- **Final position**: Returns to starting point (θ ≈ 360°/0°)
- **Time**: 88.5 minutes exactly

#### Moon
- **Angular displacement**: 0.811 degrees
- **Fraction of orbit completed**: 0.002251 (0.2251%)
- **Position**: Very small movement compared to LEO satellite

### Updated Files
1. **`porkchop.py`**: Modified to generate data for one LEO orbit duration
2. **`data_access.py`**: Updated duration and analysis sections
3. **`detailed_analysis.py`**: Modified position array generation
4. **`orbit_data.txt`**: Now contains 90 data points (88.5 minutes)
5. **`README.md`**: Updated documentation to reflect new duration

### Benefits of One Orbit Duration
- **Complete cycle visualization**: Shows one full LEO satellite orbit
- **Manageable data size**: 90 data points vs 1,441 previously
- **Clear orbital mechanics**: Demonstrates one complete orbital period
- **Moon reference**: Shows how little the Moon moves during one LEO orbit

### Data Verification
- ✅ LEO satellite starts at θ=0° and returns to θ≈360° after 88.5 minutes
- ✅ Moon moves only 0.811° during the entire LEO orbit
- ✅ All position calculations verified mathematically
- ✅ Data exported successfully to `orbit_data.txt`

The simulation now provides a focused view of orbital motion over one complete satellite orbit period, making it ideal for analyzing relative motion between the LEO satellite and Moon during a single orbital cycle.
